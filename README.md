Dice Rolling Simulator

About

This is a simple Python program that simulates rolling a dice. The user can roll the dice as many times as they want and see a random number between 1 and 6.

How to Run:

1)Download the code from the GitHub repository.

2)Open the project folder on your computer.

3)Run the program using Python.

Example:

Program: "Would you like to roll the dice? (yes/no)"

User: "yes"

Program: "You rolled the dice, and the result is: 4"

Features:

1)Rolls a dice and gives a random number between 1 and 6.

2)Handles user input errors (e.g., if you type something other than "yes" or "no").

Future Improvements:

1)Add the ability to roll multiple dice.

2)Allow the user to choose how many sides the dice should have.

3)Add a graphical user interface (GUI).

What I Learned:

1)How to generate random numbers in Python.

2)How to handle user input in loops.

3)How to use Git and publish projects on GitHub.
